# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various coding problems from LeetCode. I solve problems in JavaScript or TypeScript, and the solutions are organized by problem number.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my problem-solving skills and my understanding of algorithms and data structures. By sharing my solutions, I hope to contribute to the learning and coding community and inspire others to explore different problem-solving approaches.

## Disclaimer

Please note that these solutions represent my own understanding and implementation of the problems at the time of submission. There may be multiple valid solutions, and the best approach can vary depending on the specific problem constraints. Additionally, LeetCode frequently updates their problem set, so it's possible that some solutions may no longer be optimal or may require modifications.
